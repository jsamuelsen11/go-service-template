  description: |
    Enterprise-grade Go backend service template implementing Clean/Hexagonal Architecture.

    ## Health Endpoints

    The service exposes health endpoints under the `/-/` prefix:
    - `/-/live` - Liveness probe (always returns 200 if process is running)
    - `/-/ready` - Readiness probe (checks all registered health checkers)
    - `/-/build` - Build information (version, commit, build time)
    - `/-/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

    ## Error Handling

    All errors follow a standard envelope format with error code, message, and optional details.
    Trace IDs are included when available for debugging.

        Returns 200 OK if the process is running.
        Used by Kubernetes liveness probes to detect if the container needs restart.
        This endpoint does NOT check dependencies - that's what readiness is for.
